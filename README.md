# The story so far...

Once upon a time in land far, far away, there was a little town called Derp Town.

The citizens of Derp Town were a proud bunch, and one day they decided that they would create
their own university for the betterment of all human-kind (and, of course, to show those snobby
villagers over in Herp Town that they were not to be outdone).

The villagers were a poor but sincere lot and they were determined to build their university the
Right Way&#8482;. They formed a Board of Directors (this was Modern Times, after all, and the
old, fuddy-duddy Academic Council could leave their robes at home, *thankyouverymuch*) and resolved
that their university would do the best of everything. It would be the most grand university in all
the land. (Being more grand than the nearby Herp College, of course, was a thought that occurred to
nobody at all and the citizens would not have *dreamed* of slighting their neighbours.)

The university had no technology budget or staff to speak of yet, but that was not to stop them
from becoming the market leader in technological engagement with their students, who would travel
over all the lands and across all the seas to study at such a prestigious institution and gaze
with awe upon the wonder that was Derp University's... **Enrolment Portal**.

Undeterred by their lack of suitably qualified engineers, and being a resourceful lot, they asked the
teenage child of the Dean of the Rainbows and Unicorns faculty to write their grand portal using the
latest and greatest technologies of the time. It would, they claimed, be a sight to behold.

The portal was unveiled, and all gasped with wonder, for it was great. The villagers rejoiced and
praised the Board of Directors for their foresight and wisdom.

Of course, there were a few hitches along the way; a few things that went mysteriously wrong and a
couple of enrolments that got eaten by the Terrible Greedy Fossifoo who snuck into the system one
night, but by and large the villagers were pleased.

One fine day, the Dean's teenage offspring decided to embark upon an adventure. The child packed
some belongings, said some good-byes and set off to find the Ivory Tower of the Architect. The
villagers rejoiced, for the Architect would surely praise their Enrolment Portal and speak of them
in tones of wonder. (And not at all smug, of course, that Herp College had never seen or spoken to
the Architect or been so praised.)

During the time in which the Dean's teenage child and creator of the Enrolment Portal was adventuring,
it came time for the villagers to extend the portal. While it had been quite good for the first
semester of Derp University's existence, a few (very minor, of course) shortcomings had come to
light. Although the portal's author had been the only one to know all the ins and outs of the system,
the villagers were confident that these shortcomings could surely be quickly addressed by the villagers
themselves if they merely put their minds to it.

Weeks came and went; mid-term examinations happened; students caroused; the leaves began to brown and
the seasons to turn. The villagers were no closer to making the required changes to their vaunted
portal, and time was running out.

The villagers knew fear.

The villagers worked, and patched, and cobbled, and hacked, and eventually they came to
accept that their vaunted Enrolment Portal was unknowable by any but its author, and its author was
nowhere to be found.

The villagers knew despair.

In their misery, the villagers came to accept that what they had created for their university had not
been Done Right This Time&#8482;, but instead was a Brand New Legacy Application&#8482;.

A young traveller from far away chose this moment to enter the village, seeking food and shelter. The
traveller carried in their luggage a USB stick, upon which the villagers discovered wondrous tomes
of knowledge and tools of refactoring. In desperation, the villagers begged the traveller to renew their
hopes and restore their grand Enrolment Portal to its former glory.

Despite being young and inexperienced, the traveller took pity upon the villagers and agreed to aid them.

# Making Legacy Apps Awesome

Hi!

Firstly, thank you for signing up for the "Making Legacy Apps Awesome" workshop. We think
and hope that you'll get a lot out of it.

In case you haven't worked it out yet, the young traveller is you. You've been lumped with a legacy
app that you didn't create, don't particularly understand and almost certainly don't like.

In this case, the app is Derp University's Enrolment Portal, and your mission is as follows:

* Figure out what on earth the app does.
* Get it into a maintainable state.
* Extend it to allow the university to handle enrolments for multiple semesters.
* Ship it before winter arrives (i.e. in two days, when the workshop concludes).
* Understand how to make an awful app awesome and keep it that way.

Before the workshop, your laptop should contain:

* Microsoft [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng) 2010 or 2012. We recommend 2012.
* Microsoft [SQL Server 2012 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/editions/2012-editions/express.aspx). It would be a good idea to install this in advance as it takes a while.
* JetBrains [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper). You can get a 30-day trial if you don't have a licence.
* The installer for JetBrains [TeamCity](http://ww.jetbrains.com/teamcity). Install it in advance if you want but that isn't required.
* The installers for [Octopus Deploy](http://octopusdeploy.com/) (grab the Octopus Server, Octopus Tentacle and TeamCity Plugin downloads). You don't need to install this in advance.
* IIS installed on your laptop. You can have IIS Express as well but you will want the **full version of IIS** installed, otherwise we can't mimic a production system.
* A Git client of some description. Download [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download) if you're not familiar with Git. Don't worry - we won't be doing anything scary with it.
* [smtp4dev](http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/)
* A [backup](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d3ejfriu3aewqpt/DerpUniversity.bak) of the app's database. It would be a good idea to restore this to SQL Server Express beforehand just so you know how to do it.

The hashtags for the day are #Readify #DevDay and your presenters are [@uglybugger](https://twitter.com/uglybugger) and [@kkozmic](https://twitter.com/kkozmic). By all means, please have fun - but be nice.

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
